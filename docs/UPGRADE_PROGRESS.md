# Compact Upgrade Progress

## Preparation baseline

- Date: 2026-07-21
- Dependency command: `npm install` (no `package-lock.json` existed initially).
- Installed declared dependency ranges only; `node_modules` remains ignored.
- Initial registry attempt encountered a transient `ECONNRESET`; bounded retry succeeded.
- Pre-change `npm run lint`: **passed** (`tsc --noEmit`).
- Pre-change `npm run build`: **passed** (Vite frontend and esbuild server bundle).

## Phase 0 — Preserve and Protect the Current Baseline

Status: Complete.

Planned/implemented foundation changes:

- Numbered, repeatable, transactional migrations.
- Safe opt-in demo data seeding with no startup deletion.
- Stable vector index creation without routine drop/rebuild.
- Failed embeddings remain unindexed rather than receiving random vectors.
- Conversation deletion preserves associated Work Product.
- Generated drafts no longer create parallel Source documents.

Schema changes:

- Add `schema_migrations` tracking table.
- Preserve the existing schema through migration 001.
- Change the draft/thread foreign key to `ON DELETE SET NULL` through migration 002.

Verification:

- `npm test`: passed, 2 tests.
- `npm run lint`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- Code-path verification confirms disabled seeding returns before demo writes and no startup cleanup delete remains.
- No live database migration was executed because no deployment database/legacy credentials were supplied to this verification environment.

## Phase 1 — Authentication and Ownership

Status: Complete (code and static verification; live legacy migration requires deployment secrets/database).

Implemented:

- Migration 003 adds nullable legacy-safe password/timestamp columns, case-insensitive unique email index, and server-side sessions.
- Deterministic legacy migration requires all three approved environment variables, validates the exact User/Firm relationship and Matter/document consistency, assigns only null legacy ownership, and fails safely on missing/ambiguous ownership.
- Salted Node `scrypt` password hashes and constant-time verification.
- Secure random session tokens; only SHA-256 token hashes are stored.
- Seven-day server-side sessions with HTTP-only, `SameSite=Lax` cookies and production-only `Secure`.
- Signup, login, logout, and session-me endpoints.
- All other APIs require a server-validated session.
- Signup creates one empty firm, one user, and one authenticated session transactionally.
- Monochrome login/signup gate and sidebar account email/logout control.
- Removed all first/default/fallback user and firm database selection.

Verification:

- `npm test`: passed, 5 tests.
- `npm run lint`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- No live database or legacy secret was available, so database-backed signup/login and the legacy backfill require manual deployment verification.

## Phase 2 — Search and Context Isolation

Status: Not started.
